## Project Objective

The goal of this project was to implement Tomasulo's algorithm and execute a set of instructions to verify its correct operation. 
To achieve this, various subsystems were developed, including the Reservation Station, Register File, Common Data Bus, and Issue logic. 
These components were combined to construct the final circuit, ensuring the accurate functionality of the algorithm.
